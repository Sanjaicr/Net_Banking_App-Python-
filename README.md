# ðŸ’» Net Banking Application (Python)

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
The **Net Banking App** is a simple command-line Python application that simulates basic online banking operations.  
Users can register, log in, deposit money, withdraw funds, check balances, and view transaction histories â€” all stored locally as text files.
